INSTALL Requirements
On older systems:
	sudo apt-get install python-argparse
Normally:
	sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib python-lxml python-numpy

To use fio with a device root privileges are required.
-Add the modules to the PYTHONPATH to run 'runTest.py' from command line:
  export PYTHONPATH=/io_perf_test/src/
-Call the script with sudo an preserve the PYTHONPATH:
  sudo PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH python runTest.py
-Add an alias for that command to call it more comfortable

  Generate pdf report
To generate a pdf from the rst use rst2pdf:
$ rst2pdf test.rst test.pdf

  Loading from an xml file
To load an already carried out test from the generated xml file, use the -xml option:
$ sudo PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH python runTest.py ssd intel520 /dev/sdb1 -xml
In this case nothing happens with /dev/sdb1, it is just there as a placeholder.
Loading from an xml file is useful if something has changed in the plotting methods.
