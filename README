== Disclaimer ==
* !!!!! ATTENTION !!!!!
  * All data on the tested device is lost! The given device becomes overwritten
  multiple times, for SSDs a secure erase is carried out also.
  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

== Requirements ==
* The following python packages are required:
  * logging
  * json
  * lxml
  * subprocess
  * datetime
  * argparse
  * copy
  * collections
  * numpy
  * matplotlib
  * os
  Under Ubuntu it is normally sufficient to install:
	$ sudo apt-get install python-argparse python-matplotlib \
	  python-lxml python-numpy python-simplejson
* The following software is required:
  * FIO version 2.0.3 or higher.
    Please note that older FIO versions are not supported due to an incompatibility
    in the terse output of FIO. The tests will not produce any valuable 
    information if FIO is older than 2.0.3.
  * hdparm
  * sg3-utils

== Setup ==
* TKperf checks if FIO is found with:
	$ which fio
  Please ensure that FIO is in your path and executable.
* To install FIO visit
	http://freecode.com/projects/fio
* To fetch FIO per git use:
	$ git clone git://git.kernel.dk/fio.git
* An installation howto (currently only in German):
	http://www.thomas-krenn.com/de/wiki/Fio_kompilieren

== Installation ==
* To install TKperf simply call
	$ sudo python setup.py install
* If the source is updated with git ensure to reinstall TKperf.

== Hardware Prerequisites ==
* To carry out a Secure Erase it is necessary that the SSD is NOT in the
  frozen state.
  (http://www.thomas-krenn.com/en/wiki/SSD_Secure_Erase#Step_1:_NOT_Frozen)
  If the SSD is frozen un- and replug the device while the host is on.

== Running a test ==
* The main script file is called tkperf:
	$ which tkperf
	/usr/local/bin/tkperf
* Call tkperf with the command line options described below.
  To get the help output use:
	$ tkperf -h

== Log File ==
* The log file is named after the given test name (e.g. 'intel320' in the
  example below). Inspect the log from time to time to ensure that no errors
  occur. In the log all calls to FIO are stated out. Also the results from the
  steady rounds are written to the log file. If you have any doubts that the 
  results in the pdf report are correct check the log what performance values
  FIO returned. As the log file contains the FIO output in terse version, read
  the FIO HOWTO to find out how to interpret it.
  If a report is generated from the xml file a seperate log is created. This log
  gets '.xml' appended.

== Examples ==
* To run a test on a remote machine and ensure it is not stopped if the
  connection closes it is good practice to start the script in a screen session.
  See 'man screen' for more information. Basically it is sufficient to call
  'screen', start the script and then detach with 'Ctrl-a d'.
* As root:
	# tkperf ssd intel320 /dev/sde -nj 2 -iod 16 -rfb
* If hdparm does not output any valuable information for your device,
  use a description file to provide the device informations:
	# tkperf ssd intel320 /dev/sde -nj 2 -iod 16 -rfb -dsc intel320.dsc
* Also nohup could be used to start a test. To disable the warning that the
  device will be erased ('-ft', '--force-test'). Note that with nohup it is
  difficult to use sudo and redirect stdout/stderr to output files.
	# nohup tkperf ssd intel320 /dev/sde -ft -nj 2 \
	  -iod 16 -rfb 1>runTest.out 2>runTest.err &

== SSD Compression ==
* If the SSD controller uses compression use the '-rfb' switch to ensure that
  data buffers used by FIO are completely random. This option enables the
  'refill_buffers' from FIO.

== Description File ==
* If 'hdparm -I' does not provide any valuable information about a drive, you
  have to provide a so called 'description file'. This file just contains some
  meta information for the pdf report and so it can be a simple text file
  describing the tested device. When calling the script provide the path to the
  description file with '-dsc PATH_TO_FILE'.

== Generate a PDF report ==
* To generate a pdf from the rst use rst2pdf:
	$ rst2pdf test.rst test.pdf

== Loading from XML ==
* To load an already carried out test from the generated xml file, use
  the '-xml' option:
	$ sudo tkperf ssd intel520 none -xml
* In this case as tested device 'none' is used, it is there just as a placeholder.
* Loading from an xml file is useful if something has changed in the plotting
  methods and you want to re-plot the results. This is mainly required during a
  development process or if a major update/bugfix has been made to tkperf.

== Creating compare plots ==
* With the help of the generated xml files multiple devices can be compared (up
  to seven devices). The script 'tkperf-cmp' generates the compare plots for
  write saturation, throughput, IOPS and latency. To generate the plots use:
  $ tkperf-cmp ssd Samsung840PRO-256GB.xml Samsung840EVO-250GB.xml

== Further information ==
* To get more information about how the SSD tests are carried out, visit
  http://www.snia.org/tech_activities/standards/curr_standards/pts for the
  standard these tests are based on.
